# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM BY AUTOMATIC

# INTRODUCTION
### In this  wiper controll system in automatic project,I would like to note that, even though thethe fact that almost every aspect of this design has already been specified, there are still several changes that may be made to make it more convenient. The project we have built and presented is quite efficient and cost-effective.

 # WIPER CONTROL
 ### The introduction of a speed-controlling mechanism to this project will enable it to work in line with the intensity and velocity of the water flowing through the sensor. The essential maneuvering is just performed to make it much more cost-effective and dependable over time. The concept I have created is fully functional and may be utilized in any sort of automobile. This wiper system maY be made automated by adding sensors for rain water dropping on the wind shield, dust resistance sensors, etc. Therefore, there is no need to manually regulate the windshield wiper system while driving. It would be more convenient if extra functions were added to the wiper system, and this might be accomplished soonthe near future. People from all across the globe continue to work on this project so that we may create a system that needs less human interaction to function.
